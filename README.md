# Sites, samples, observations &amp; results database (Geological properties database)

One of the primary purposes of the Geological Survey of Queensland (GSQ) is to improve understanding of Queensland's resource potential.

GSQ creates, collects and provides geoscience data, information and advice on Queenslandâ€™s mineral resources, coal, coal seam gas, petroleum, including unconventional petroleum, oil shale and geothermal energy. GSQ creates this knowledge through a range of geoscience projects and initiatives including industry exploration grants.

In summary, GSQ seeks to understand the geological properties of the State of Queensland, both surface and sub-surface.

### A plain English definition
We seek to understand the geological properties of a geological or administrative feature. We underake a survey
on the feature, either as a whole feature, or on subsets of the feature. The survey yields samples. We conduct observations on the samples using a particular procedure. The observation yields results as measured values. We interpret the results to understand the geological properties of the feature.

### Definitions
#### Geological property
* The observable or measureable properties of a geological or administrative feature.  
* Examples: minerals, hydrocarbons, water properties.  

#### Geological or administrative feature
* Geological features have properties that are of interest for commercial, environmental and societal reasons.  
* Administrative features are spatial features that are defined and managed by regulatory agencies.
* Examples: basin, orogen, province, traugh, craton, permit, sub-block.

#### Site
* A sub-set of the geological or administrative feature.  
* Examples: borehole, stream, seismic line.

#### Survey
* The one-off event of examination of a geological or administrative feature.
* Examples: seismic survey, geochemical survey, gravity survey, magnetotelluric survey.

#### Sample
* The enduring extract from the geological feature.  
* Examples: 

#### Observation
* An act of carrying out an observation using a _procedure_ to estimate or calculate a value of a geological or administrative feature.
* Examples: 

#### Result
* The result of the observation stored as a value together with the unit.  
* Examples: concentrations, quality, reserve size
