# Sites, samples, observations &amp; results database <br>(Geological Properties Database)

One of the primary purposes of the Geological Survey of Queensland (GSQ) is to improve understanding of Queensland's resource potential.

GSQ creates, collects and provides geoscience data, information and advice on Queenslandâ€™s mineral resources, coal, coal seam gas, petroleum, including unconventional petroleum, oil shale and geothermal energy. GSQ creates this knowledge through a range of geoscience projects and initiatives including industry exploration grants.

In summary, GSQ seeks to understand the geological properties of the State of Queensland, both surface and sub-surface.

### A plain English definition
We seek to understand the geological properties of a geological or administrative feature. We undertake a survey
on the feature, either as a whole feature, or on subsets of the feature. The survey yields samples. We conduct observations on the samples using a particular procedure. The observation yields results as measured values. We interpret the results to understand the geological properties of the feature.

### Definitions
#### Geological property
* The observable or measureable properties of a geological or administrative feature.  
* Examples: minerals, hydrocarbons, water properties.  

#### Geological or administrative feature
* Geological features have properties that are of interest for commercial, environmental and societal reasons.  
* Administrative features are spatial features that are defined and managed by regulatory agencies.
* Examples: basin, orogen, province, traugh, craton, permit, sub-block, resource accumulation.
* See [GSQ Geological and Administrative Features vocabulary](https://vocabs.gsq.digital/vocabulary/gsq-features) and [GSQ Geo Admin Features Ontology](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/gsq-geoadminfeatures-ont)

#### Site
* A sub-set of the geological or administrative feature.  
* Examples: borehole, stream, seismic line.
* See the [GSQ Site Profile](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/gsq-site-profile)

#### Survey
* The one-off event of examination of a geological or administrative feature. 
* The type of exploration work.
* Examples: seismic survey, geochemical survey, gravity survey, magnetotelluric survey.
* See [Exploration Work Types](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/ssor-database/blob/master/Exploration%20work%20type.md)
* See [GSQ Survey Profile](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/gsq-survey-profile)

#### Sample
* The enduring extract from the geological feature.  
* Examples: drillcore, rock chip, soil sample, photograph, water.
* See the [GSQ Sample Profile](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/gsq-sample-profile)

#### Observation
* An act of carrying out an observation using a _procedure_ to estimate or calculate a value of a geological or administrative feature.
* Examples: 
* See the [GSQ Observation Profile](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/gsq-observation-profile)

#### Result
* The result of the observation stored as a value together with the unit.  
* Examples: concentration, quality, reserve size, weight, conductivity, vicosity, temperaure.
* See [Units of measure](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/ssor-database/blob/master/Units%20of%20measure.md)

## The Geological Properties Database
The Geological Survey of Queensland is creating a new Geological Properties database as the single source of truth for historical and new data.

### Objectives of the Geological Properties Database
* Replace the existing Surface Geology functionality in the MERLIN system.  
* Replace the Cores and Cuttings functionality in MERLIN.  
* Replace the Mineral Occurrences functionality in MERLIN.  
* Replace the Aerial Geophysics functionality in GEM.
* Capture the primary Geochemical data recorded in the Explorer3 system.  
* Provide a repository for new data created by the department.  
* Provide a repository for new data submitted to the department.
